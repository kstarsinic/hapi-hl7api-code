			<p>
				To use Encryption Profile, you have three options:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You may use TLS Mutual Authentication with a symmetric secret key. (TODO: finish this description)
				</li>
				<li>
					You may install a certificate which has been signed by a trusted 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate Authority (CA)</a>.
					This approach generally has the advantage of requiring almost no 
					configuration effort on the client/sending side, but there is generally
					a cost associated with obtaining a certificate which has been signed by a CA. This
					is a good approach if you have a single application (e.g. an interface engine or a
					regional repository)	which will receive messages from many sources. 					
				</li>
				<li>
					You may use a self-signed certificate. Self-signed certificates
					provide excellent security at the expense of requiring extra
					configuration on the client side.
				</li>
			</ul>
