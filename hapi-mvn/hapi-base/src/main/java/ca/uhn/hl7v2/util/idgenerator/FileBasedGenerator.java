/**
 * Replacement for {@link ca.uhn.hl7v2.util.MessageIDGenerator}. You should not use this class
 * directly, however, but wrap it into a {@link DelegatingHiLoGenerator} generator. Its primary
 * improvement over {@link ca.uhn.hl7v2.util.MessageIDGenerator} is that you can set path and file
 * name.
 * <p>
 * Reading and writing to the file is thread-safe, however, you should not use the same file from
 * different Java processes because no read/write locks are being checked.
