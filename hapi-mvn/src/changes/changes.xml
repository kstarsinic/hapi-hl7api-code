            description="This release brings some bug fixes and a
  few enhancements. The primary focus of this release is in fixing issues relating to
  parsing and encoding. In particular, a number of issues specific to parsing of
  OBX-5 (Varies) values have been corrected.">
            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew">
            	Fix one regression in HAPI 1.2-beta1, where a group containing at least one
            	mandatory segment would sometimes be encoded as an empty segment 
            	even if no content was added to it.
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="James Agnew">
            	Add two new system properties which allow OBX segments messages to be parsed
            	even if they are either missing, or have an invalid value in OBX-2 (which defines
            	the datatype used in OBX-5).

            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew">
            	When encoding a group using the PipeParser where the first segment is required, but no data has been populated in that segment, 
            	the empty segment is now still encoded if needed as a blank segment in order to give parsers a hint about which 
            	group further segments are in. This helps to ensure that messages can be "round tripped", meaning that
            	a message which is parsed, encoded, and then re-parsed should contain exactly the same structure from
            	beginning to end. 
            	For example, in an ORU^R01 message with a populated OBX segment, but no data
            	in the mandatory OBR segment which begins the ORDER_OBSERVATION group (see 
            	<![CDATA[<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/v26/apidocs/ca/uhn/hl7v2/model/v26/group/ORU_R01_ORDER_OBSERVATION.html">reference</a>]]>),
            	the message would still contain an empty OBR segment when encoded:

	OBR|
	OBX||ST|||Value Data
</pre>
				]]>
				Previously, the following encoding would have occurred, which would have incorrectly been parsed as
				having a custom OBX segment instead of having a normal ORDER_OBSERVATION group:

            	interface now has a new method: isGroup(String). This method allows callers to determine
            	if a child structure is a segment or a group. The only provided implementation, AbstractGroup,
            	implements this method, so the API change should not have any effect on users.
            </action>
            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew">
            	Restore missing get[FIELD_NAME]Reps() methods from segments. These were accidentally removed
            	with the conversion to a Velocity based structure generator, but they have now been
            	restored.

            	Avoid a NullPointerException if a null value is passed into the "setValue(Date)" or 
            	"setValue(Calendar)" methods on a DT, TS, or TM datatype. Passing in a null now
            	simply clears any existing value, bringing these methods in line with
            	the behaviour of the "setValue(String)" method. 
            	Thanks to Michael for reporting!

            <action type="fix" dev="Axel Biernat" issue="3308845">
            	Avoid line wrapping when XML encoding messages using the XMLParser. This means
            	that values with very long strings won't have unexpected breaks added when
            	they are encoded and re-parsed. 
            </action>
            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew">
            	Correct issue where extra components in primitive types within OBX-5 appear twice when
            	message is re-encoded. This is useful, for example, if you are receiving messages
            	from a system which is not correctly escaping ampersands or carats within
            	an OBX-5 value. Prior to chis change, a message containing the following
            	segment:
				<![CDATA[
<pre>
   OBX||ST|||F1C1^F2C1&F2C2

				]]>

				Thanks to Andbuty Choy for finding this.

            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew" issue="3306358">
            	Prevent MessageIDGenerator (used to generate message control IDs for ACK messages, for example in SimpleServer)
            	from throwing an exception if it is not able to parse the value found in id_file. Previously if something
            	went wrong and this file was blank, a hard to debug exception was thrown. Now, control ID sequencing is simply
            	reset to zero. Thanks to an anonymous bug submittor.
            </action>
            <action type="fix" dev="Rodolfo Chavez" issue="3264566">
            	Fix an issue where inserting/removing a repetition of the very last field in a segment
            	fails due to an incorrect range check in AbstractSegment. Thanks Rodolfo for submitting! 
            </action>
            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew" issue="3212931">
            	Where multiple structures are marked as associated with the same trigger event 
            	(example: ORN_O02 and ORR_O02 are both indicated as matching trigger ORR^O02) the
            	parser will favour the structure whose name matches the event type and trigger (ORR_O02 in the
            	previous example) when parsing a message with no structure explicitly defined in MSH-9-3.
            </action>
            <action type="fix" dev="Ryan W. Gross">
            	Fix an issue where subcomponents within a Varies (OBX-5) value are incorrectly handled. For example,
            	if OBX-2 specifies a composite type, and the first component is also a composite, the first subcomponent
            	(represented by the text F1C2 below) would be lost.
