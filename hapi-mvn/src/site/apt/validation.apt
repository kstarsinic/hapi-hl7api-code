Validation of HL7 messages

* Introduction
  
  HL7 v2.x is a complex flat-file structure that, despite being considered a data standard, 
  is also highly flexible. It is often expected of an HL7 library that non-standard compliant 
  data be accepted and processed without notification to the receiving system of non-compliance.

  However, to achieve real interoperability, the HL7 standard should be constrained to reduce the 
  degree of freedom e.g. how to use certain fields or whether to populate optional fields or not. 
  This happens either based on a written specification or in addition as machine-readble conformance profile. 
  In order to check whether HL7 messages actually conform to the defined constraints, message validation is essential.

  The HAPI library already offers support for validating HL7 messages by definition of rules 
  that check against constraints on primitive type level, message level, and encoded message level. 
  
  In addition to the naked message rule implementations, HAPI has support for specifying validation rules 
  in a way that is particularly easy to write and easy to understand and facilitates the definition 
  of custom validation rules.
