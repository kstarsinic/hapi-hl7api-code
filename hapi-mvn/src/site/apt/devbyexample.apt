Developing using HAPI - By Example

  This page is intended to explain how to develop an application
  that uses HAPI to send or receive messages, using straightforward
  examples. 
  
  It is a new section of the HAPI documentation, and is still
  very much a work in progress. If you have any 
  comments/suggestions/corrections, please send them to
  {{mailto:jamesagnew@sourceforge.net}}.

  Please note that this page assumes at least a basic familiarity 
  with {{{http://hl7.org}HL7}} and it's terminology.

* Parsing a message

  A good starting point with regards to using HAPI would be to
  {{{xref/ca/uhn/hl7v2/examples/ExampleParseMessages.html}parse a message}}.
  
* Creating messages

  Next, let's try {{{xref/ca/uhn/hl7v2/examples/CreateAMessage.html}creating a new message}}
  from scratch.

* Sending and receiving
  
  Now, let's introduce some {{{xref/ca/uhn/hl7v2/examples/SendAndReceiveAMessage.html}network operations}}.

* Advanced

  Another way of reading and writing to message objects is to use 
  a {{{xref/ca/uhn/hl7v2/examples/ExampleUseTerser.html}Terser}}
