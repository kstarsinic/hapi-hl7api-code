		<section name="HAPI - The Open Source Java HL7 Parser and API">

			<p>
				This is the home page for the HAPI project. HAPI (HL7 application
				programming interface;
				pronounced "happy") is an open-source,
				object-oriented HL7 2.x parser for
				Java.
				HL7
				(
				<a href="http://hl7.org">http://hl7.org</a>
				)
				is a messaging specification for healthcare information systems.
				This project is not affiliated with the HL7 organization; we are
				just
				writing some software
				that conforms to their specification. The
				project was initiated by
				<a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a>
				(a large multi-site teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada).

			<p>
				On October 30 2001. Bryan Tripp and a team at University Health Network registered the HAPI
				project with Sourceforge, and a new project was born. On November 15 2001 HAPI 0.1 was
				released, and 10
				releases later HAPI is probably the most widely used HL7 v2
				library there is.
